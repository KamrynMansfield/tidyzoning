The purpose of the tidyzoning package is to analyze housing capacity under current zoning laws. It is designed to read three types of datasets. 

- **tidybuilding:** A json file with attributes to represent a building 

- **tidyzoning:** A geojson file of city zoning codes formatted to follow the Open Zoning Feed Specification

- **tidyparcel:** A geojson of with the city's parcel data with labeled parcel sides (front, side interior, side exterior, rear) and parcel dimensions (lot_width, lot_depth, lot_area)

The functions of tiyzoning allow the user to find which parcels allow the specified building based on the zoning regulations of each parcel. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidyzoning from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KamrynMansfield/tidyzoning")
```

## Example



```{r example}
library(tidyzoning)
unify_tidybuilding("inst/extdata/bldg_12_fam.json")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
