\description{
`check_land_use()` takes a tidybuilding and a tidydistrict to see if the district's zoning code allows the tidybuilding based on land use.

`check_land_use_exceptions()`, like `check_land_use()`, will see if the district's zoning code allows the tidybuilding based on land use.
But this function also return TRUE if the land use is recorded in the tidyzoning as a potential exception.
