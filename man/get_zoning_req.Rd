\title{Get district zoning requirements}
\usage{
get_zoning_req(tidybuilding, tidydistrict, tidyparcel = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tidybuilding}{A tidybuilding object is a special features object representing a building.}

\item{tidydistrict}{The tidydistrict corresponding to the tidyparcel. A tidydistrict object is one row from a tidyzoning simple features object.}

\item{tidyparcel}{A tidyparcel object is an simple features object depicting each side of a parcel and its label (front, Interior side, Exterior side, rear).}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with the value each zoning requirement for that specific building, parcel, and zoning district.
NA values indicate the requirement isn't recorded in that district.
If every value is NA, it could indicate that the building land use is not allowed in the zoning district.
}
\description{
Because many zoning requirements depend on the proposed building or the parcel of that zoning district, `the get_zoning_req()` function takes a tidybuilding, a tidyparcel, and a tidydistrict and outputs a data frame listing the set zoning requirements that those three objects would create.
If every value is NA, it could indicate that the building land use is not allowed in the zoning district.
